### Python

#### General code style
Most of the code style is covered by our preferred formatter, black (<sub><a href="https://github.com/psf/black"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg" alt="Code style: black"></a></sub>).

Tab size 4 spaces, spaces style.




### Git commit messages

#### General convention

For git commit messages, it is recommended to write them in past tense (e.g. `Added`, `Updated`) and with `Title Case`.

#### Commit message emojis and meaning

NOTICE: Any emoji specified here *are **not*** only limited to only one skin tone: This list just includes one for simplicity. Also, **if any of the emojis listed here have a Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) equivalent, you may also use that. If any of these emojis are not supported by your system, let me know.** [**Contact me**](#contacts).

It is recommended to stick to one constuct in a commit message: either completely use [GFM emoji shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908 "Complete list of github markdown emoji markup") or use Unicode emojis.
