# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to learn how to contribute! Not only reading this help your contribution to get more likely accepted, it'll help you in the future for all projects made from the [ThatXliner/Pytemplate](https://github.com/ThatXliner/Pytemplate) template!

## Styles

All kinds of styles (e.g. code style, git commit style, comment style, etc) will be discussed here.

### Python

#### General code style

Most of the code style is covered by our preferred formatter, black (<sub><a href="https://github.com/psf/black"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg" alt="Code style: black"></a></sub>).

The hard line limit (in characters) is `90`. The soft limit is `80` to `88`. But it is recommended to set your editor's soft wrap at 88 characters.

Tab size 4 spaces, spaces style.

### Git commit messages

I must admit, I personally don't like to write detailed commit messages. But now, I find a need to. So, here is the `git` commit message writing guidelines.

#### General convention

For git commit messages, it is preferreed to write actions in past tense (e.g. `Added`, `Updated`) and with `Title Case`.

Try to add emojis in your commits. They make it more fun to read :smile:. See the [commit emoji guide](#commit-message-emojis-and-meaning).

If the commit was made by a robot, you should prefix it with a <code>:robot:|:some_other_emoji:</code>

If there's a `[skip ci]` message, put it in the description (i.e., two lines below the title)

#### Commit message emojis and meaning.

It is recommended to stick to one constuct in a commit message: either completely use [**GFM emoji shortcuts**](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908 "Complete list of github markdown emoji markup") or use Unicode emojis. **Limit the emojis up to 5 per commit title.**
